🌙 Dark Mode Toggle

A simple and elegant Dark Mode Toggle built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to switch between light and dark themes with a smooth transition — improving user experience and visual comfort.

🚀 Features

🌗 Toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode
💾 Saves user preference using localStorage
⚡ Smooth color transition for better UI experience
🎨 Fully responsive and customizable design
🧠 Implemented using vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – For structure
CSS3 – For styling and smooth animations
JavaScript (ES6) – For theme switching logic

💡 How It Works

The HTML contains a toggle button (switch or icon).
The CSS defines two themes — light and dark.
The JavaScript listens for toggle clicks and dynamically updates the theme.
The selected mode is saved in localStorage, so the user’s choice persists on page reload.
